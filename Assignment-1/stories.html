        <p style="font-size: 16px;">In the beautiful place called Kalam, my cousins and I had a fantastic two-day trip to Shahi Bagh. It was a truly peaceful and stunning spot with lovely gardens and a river. During the day, we explored forests, found hidden waterfalls, and had a great time. But the best part was our evenings. We sat around a warm bonfire, told stories, ate delicious BBQ food, and looked at the stars. It was a short trip, but it made our family bonds stronger, and we'll always remember the beautiful nature and fun we had at Shahi Bagh. However, it was the evenings at Shahi Bagh that cast a magical spell on us. Gathered around a warm bonfire, the flickering flames painted our faces with a golden glow as we shared stories and laughed wholeheartedly. The aroma of sizzling BBQ food wafted through the air, making our taste buds dance with delight. Under a sky adorned with countless stars, we felt like a small part of the universe, connected to the wilderness around us.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;">To kick off the year 2022 in style, my family and I chose to celebrate New Year's in the picturesque setting of Malam Jabba, Pakistan. Surrounded by snow and lush forests, we stayed at the comfortable PC Hotel. With nature's beauty all around us, our New Year's celebration was magical. As the clock ticked towards midnight, we gathered around a cozy bonfire, our faces filled with excitement and hope. The starry night sky and the chilly mountain air added to the thrill. When the clock struck midnight, we held hands, shared good wishes, and toasted to new beginnings. The sound of laughter and the happiness of being together made it a New Year's Eve we'll always remember with joy.</p>
